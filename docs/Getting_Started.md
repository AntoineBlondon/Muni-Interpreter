# Getting Started with Muni

Welcome to Muni, a dynamic, expressive programming language designed for ease of use and readability. This guide will help you set up your development environment and walk you through writing your first Muni script.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Prerequisites
- A modern operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- Python 3.6 or later

### Installation
1. **Download Muni Interpreter:** You can download the latest version of the Muni interpreter from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AntoineBlondon/Muni-Interpreter).
2. **Install Dependencies:** Muni requires Python 3.6 or later. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Setting Up the Interpreter
- Extract the downloaded Muni interpreter to a directory of your choice.
- Add the Muni interpreter's directory to your system's PATH environment variable for easy access from the command line.

## Writing Your First Muni Script

### Create a New Script
- Open your favorite text editor or IDE.
- Create a new file with the `.mun` extension, for example, `hello_world.mun`.

### Write a Simple Program
Let's write a simple script that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

```muni
# hello_world.mun
print("Hello, World!");
```

### Explanation
- `print` is a built-in function in Muni that outputs text to the console.
- Muni uses semicolons `;` to terminate statements.

### Running Your Script
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory containing your script.
- Run the script with the Muni interpreter:

  ```
  mun hello_world.mun
  ```

You should see "Hello, World!" printed in the console.

## Next Steps
- **Experiment:** Try modifying the `hello_world.mun` script to print different messages.
- **Learn More:** Read the [Muni Language Reference](Language_Reference/Syntax.md) to understand more about Muni's syntax and features.
- **Practice:** Write more scripts to familiarize yourself with Muni's syntax and standard library.

## Getting Help
- **Documentation:** Refer to the [Muni documentation](README.md) for detailed guides and references.
- **Issues:** If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please report them on the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/AntoineBlondon/Muni-Interpreter/issues).

Congratulations on running your first Muni script! You're now ready to explore the world of Muni programming. Happy coding!
